        <span class="small-caps">Carl Van Vechten</span> (1890—1964), enthusiast of Modernism and ally of the Harlem Renaissance, had a swell time while the Roaring Twenties lasted. Maybe he had too good a time—man about town, his big-toothed smile not to be missed at important theater openings and literary events, then on to suppers and cabarets. “Up at 8 with quite a hangover,” Van Vechten typically notes in his small daybook. He ceased his binge drinking as the Jazz Age turned into the Great Depression and he also stopped writing fiction. His dear friend Gertrude Stein had been right not to take his novels of decadence too seriously. Yet Van Vechten would have the Second Act that American life is not supposed to grant. He re-created himself as an artist and he became a portrait photographer of historical importance.
	    Van Vechten, born in 1890, came from a sort of rich family, and perhaps that was the source of his social confidence. He did not repudiate his class, but he did not hang out in his class much either. He’d made his way east, from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to the University of Chicago, and finally to New York, where he worked as a music reporter, cultural journalist, herald of the new in the arts. He went with Stein to the second performance of Le Sacre du Printemps in Paris in 1913, yet wrote about it in his book, Music After the Great War (1915), as if he’d attended the premiere. He knew that he led an interesting life and was not above revisions of memory in order to keep it as A-list-worthy as possible. In his marriage to Fania Marinoff, a Jewish waif of the theater, he found gen- uine companionship as well as an accommodation, however pained, of his gay love life. It is not hard to see why Van Vechten was drawn to the margins, the avant garde, the subversive high and low. He discovered ragtime in the Chicago brothels around the time of the Columbian Exposition and was reviewing black theatrical productions in New York before World War I.
	    Revolution and unrest came to Europe after the Armistice; in the United States, the war’s aftermath saw the mass migration of black people from the South to the North and white riots against blacks all over. The underlying assumptions of Western culture had been somehow discredited by the slaugh- ter of war, making the genteel tradition almost comical in its solemnities. Van
